                            At the prophetic words of Simeon, the first cruel sword has passed. Mary's great joy is turned suddenly into great sorrow...
                            as she plummets from the heights to the depths.
                            Great tears well up in the beautiful eyes of the Gentlest of Mothers. The words of the prophesy sink deep into her heart like a 
                            burning knife. Mary's tears fall gently upon the tiny babe held securely in her arms. The tender baby Jesus too, is visibly effected 
                            drawing closer to his mother in fear and trembling. Although horrified at the thought of what he must endure to save sinners from Hell
                            their answer in unison to the Father is,"yes." A complete and trustful surrender to the Will of God.
                            Both Jesus and his Immaculate Mother would endure this great sorrow ~ this great fear for the rest of their lives...A living martyrdom. 
                            Every waking moment, Mary lived with the dread and unbearable mental anguish of her beloved Son's impending death...knowing not the hour.

                            "Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there till I tell you; for Herod is about to 
                            search for the child, to destroy him." And he rose and took the child and his mother by night, and departed to Egypt, and 
                            remained there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, 
                            "Out of Egypt have I called my son."

                            And his parents went every year to Jerusalem, at the solemn day of the pasch, and when he was twelve years old, they going up into Jerusalem, 
                            according to the custom of the feast, and having fulfilled the days, when they returned, the child Jesus remained in Jerusalem; 
                            and his parents knew it not. And thinking that he was in the company, they came a day's journey, and sought him among their kinsfolk and 
                            acquaintance. And not finding him, they returned into Jerusalem, seeking him.
                            <br />
                            And it came to pass, that, after three days, they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, hearing them, and asking 
                            them questions. And all that heard him were astonished at his wisdom and his answers. And seeing him, they wondered, And his mother said to him:
                            "Son, why hast thou done so to us? Behold thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing." And he said to them: 
                            "How is it that you sought me? Did you not know, that I must be about my father's business? And they understood not the word that he spoke 
                            unto them. And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them. And his mother kept all these words in her heart. 
                            And Jesus advanced in wisdom, and age, and grace with God and men.

                            The Prophesy of Simeon is Mary and St. Joseph's greatest fear. This ever-present dread is foremost in their minds as she and poor 
                            St. Joseph search desperately for their lost son Jesus. The same fears that any parent would have for their lost child must have 
                            indeed been keenly shared by poor Mary and St. Joseph. "Where could he possibly be? Is he hungry or thirsty? Is he cold? 
                            Is he alone or afraid? Is he in danger? Is he dead? Is it my fault he is lost? Will we ever see our precious child again?

                            What does the anguished Mother witness as she is jostled by the riotous mob? <br /><br />
                            Mary's eyes behold for the first time, a glimpse of the distant bent figure of her Son, as he slowly rounds a corner,  
                            weighed down by a very large heavy cross on his shoulder.  At the same time, she sees the mass of cruel thorns they have placed on his head.  
                            As he nears, she can see the ropes that bind him around his neck and waist, and how they shove him, and prod him along with the blunt end of spears, 
                            like a driven lamb to the slaughter.  Her ears are assaulted by the loud angry insults and blasphemies they heap upon him.  
                            Jesus stumbles and falls, her arms reach for him in reflex but he is too far away, as he lies there in the filth and dust of the city street. 
                            This first fall, one of many before His journey's end. <br /><br />
                            Weakened from the loss of blood and pain suffered in the cruel scourging, suffering terribly from the painful crown that pierces his skull 
                            and pricks his eyes and ears at every movement, he can barely see for the blood that stings his eyes.  Only his tears relieve the stinging some 
                            as he blinks to see. His breathing is fast and gasping, his pulse races. The soldiers manhandle him to his feet, afraid he will die before they 
                            can nail him to the cross, shove him and yank him around by the ropes to revive him, he catches his breath and grits his teeth as all his pain 
                            is renewed with the violent treatment. <br /><br />
                            He walks on, one slow, painful step at a time. Jesus strains with all his heart, to bear the immense weight of the whole world on his shoulder.  
                            He is nearer his mother now.  She tearfully watches as he slowly, painfully, lifts his head, and she gasps...His once beautiful face,
                            swollen and bruised, covered in filth and blood and spittle!  His thick dark hair and beard matted with sweat and blood.  
                            Can you feel her anguish as their tearful eyes meet, "...My son, My son!"  You can hear her cry.
                            So many silent swords of pain passed between them in that brief look. It was not for this innocent creature that he must suffer. 
                            She alone, The Immaculate Mother of the Word Incarnate. Despite himself, what pain Jesus felt to see Mary's unbearable anguish. 
                            The soldiers shout and push the crowds back, and He is stolen from view.<br /><br /> 
                            She prays for someone come to the aid of her Son.  The soldiers grab Simon the Cyrenian, a large strong man coming in from the fields and force 
                            him to carry the heavy cross behind Jesus.<br /><br />
                            The Holy Mother prays still more fervently, and a pious woman is moved by great compassion for this poor wretched man condemned to die. Courageously, 
                            she breaks through a startled line of soldiers to wipe his bloody face with her veil.<br /><br />
                            As Veronica gently presses the veil to Jesus' face, she can feel it's features beneath the cloth.  Jesus again slowly, 
                            painfully raises his precious head to thank Veronica with his eyes, his heart, and the gift of His Sacred Image left on her veil,
                            as a visible testament to her act of kindness to this day.<br /><br />
                            Veronica never forgot the face of her savior as he looked on her with love. Despite his disturbing appearance, she is enraptured with love 
                            and sorrow for him.  The moment is suspended in time ~ and the angry world disappears. She will never be the same, as she has seen Heaven in his face.
                            The soldiers grab her indignantly and shove her back into the crowd. Our Savior is lead away to continue his slow, agonizing walk of death.

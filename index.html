                                <li>I  have obtained (This Grace) from my Divine Son, that those who propagate this devotion to my tears and dolors,

                            At the prophetic words of Simeon, the first cruel sword has passed. Mary's great joy is turned suddenly into great sorrow...
                            as she plummets from the heights to the depths.
                            Great tears well up in the beautiful eyes of the Gentlest of Mothers. The words of the prophesy sink deep into her heart like a 
                            burning knife. Mary's tears fall gently upon the tiny babe held securely in her arms. The tender baby Jesus too, is visibly effected 
                            drawing closer to his mother in fear and trembling. Although horrified at the thought of what he must endure to save sinners from Hell
                            their answer in unison to the Father is,"yes." A complete and trustful surrender to the Will of God.
                            Both Jesus and his Immaculate Mother would endure this great sorrow ~ this great fear for the rest of their lives...A living martyrdom. 
                            Every waking moment, Mary lived with the dread and unbearable mental anguish of her beloved Son's impending death...knowing not the hour.

                            "Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there till I tell you; for Herod is about to 
                            search for the child, to destroy him." And he rose and took the child and his mother by night, and departed to Egypt, and 
                            remained there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, 
                            "Out of Egypt have I called my son."

                            And his parents went every year to Jerusalem, at the solemn day of the pasch, and when he was twelve years old, they going up into Jerusalem, 
                            according to the custom of the feast, and having fulfilled the days, when they returned, the child Jesus remained in Jerusalem; 
                            and his parents knew it not. And thinking that he was in the company, they came a day's journey, and sought him among their kinsfolk and 
                            acquaintance. And not finding him, they returned into Jerusalem, seeking him.
                            <br />
                            And it came to pass, that, after three days, they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, hearing them, and asking 
                            them questions. And all that heard him were astonished at his wisdom and his answers. And seeing him, they wondered, And his mother said to him:
                            "Son, why hast thou done so to us? Behold thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing." And he said to them: 
                            "How is it that you sought me? Did you not know, that I must be about my father's business? And they understood not the word that he spoke 
                            unto them. And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them. And his mother kept all these words in her heart. 
                            And Jesus advanced in wisdom, and age, and grace with God and men.

                            The Prophesy of Simeon is Mary and St. Joseph's greatest fear. This ever-present dread is foremost in their minds as she and poor 
                            St. Joseph search desperately for their lost son Jesus. The same fears that any parent would have for their lost child must have 
                            indeed been keenly shared by poor Mary and St. Joseph. "Where could he possibly be? Is he hungry or thirsty? Is he cold? 
                            Is he alone or afraid? Is he in danger? Is he dead? Is it my fault he is lost? Will we ever see our precious child again?

                            What does the anguished Mother witness as she is jostled by the riotous mob? <br /><br />
                            Mary's eyes behold for the first time, a glimpse of the distant bent figure of her Son, as he slowly rounds a corner,  
                            weighed down by a very large heavy cross on his shoulder.  At the same time, she sees the mass of cruel thorns they have placed on his head.  
                            As he nears, she can see the ropes that bind him around his neck and waist, and how they shove him, and prod him along with the blunt end of spears, 
                            like a driven lamb to the slaughter.  Her ears are assaulted by the loud angry insults and blasphemies they heap upon him.  
                            Jesus stumbles and falls, her arms reach for him in reflex but he is too far away, as he lies there in the filth and dust of the city street. 
                            This first fall, one of many before His journey's end. <br /><br />
                            Weakened from the loss of blood and pain suffered in the cruel scourging, suffering terribly from the painful crown that pierces his skull 
                            and pricks his eyes and ears at every movement, he can barely see for the blood that stings his eyes.  Only his tears relieve the stinging some 
                            as he blinks to see. His breathing is fast and gasping, his pulse races. The soldiers manhandle him to his feet, afraid he will die before they 
                            can nail him to the cross, shove him and yank him around by the ropes to revive him, he catches his breath and grits his teeth as all his pain 
                            is renewed with the violent treatment. <br /><br />
                            He walks on, one slow, painful step at a time. Jesus strains with all his heart, to bear the immense weight of the whole world on his shoulder.  
                            He is nearer his mother now.  She tearfully watches as he slowly, painfully, lifts his head, and she gasps...His once beautiful face,
                            swollen and bruised, covered in filth and blood and spittle!  His thick dark hair and beard matted with sweat and blood.  
                            Can you feel her anguish as their tearful eyes meet, "...My son, My son!"  You can hear her cry.
                            So many silent swords of pain passed between them in that brief look. It was not for this innocent creature that he must suffer. 
                            She alone, The Immaculate Mother of the Word Incarnate. Despite himself, what pain Jesus felt to see Mary's unbearable anguish. 
                            The soldiers shout and push the crowds back, and He is stolen from view.<br /><br /> 
                            She prays for someone come to the aid of her Son.  The soldiers grab Simon the Cyrenian, a large strong man coming in from the fields and force 
                            him to carry the heavy cross behind Jesus.<br /><br />
                            The Holy Mother prays still more fervently, and a pious woman is moved by great compassion for this poor wretched man condemned to die. Courageously, 
                            she breaks through a startled line of soldiers to wipe his bloody face with her veil.<br /><br />
                            As Veronica gently presses the veil to Jesus' face, she can feel it's features beneath the cloth.  Jesus again slowly, 
                            painfully raises his precious head to thank Veronica with his eyes, his heart, and the gift of His Sacred Image left on her veil,
                            as a visible testament to her act of kindness to this day.<br /><br />
                            Veronica never forgot the face of her savior as he looked on her with love. Despite his disturbing appearance, she is enraptured with love 
                            and sorrow for him.  The moment is suspended in time ~ and the angry world disappears. She will never be the same, as she has seen Heaven in his face.
                            The soldiers grab her indignantly and shove her back into the crowd. Our Savior is lead away to continue his slow, agonizing walk of death.

                            Now there stood by the cross of Jesus, his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalen. 
                            When Jesus therefore had seen his mother and the disciple standing whom he loved, he saith to his mother: "Woman, behold thy son." 
                            After that, he saith to the disciple: "Behold thy mother". And from that hour, the disciple took her to his own.
                            <br />
                            Afterwards, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, said: "I thirst". 
                            Now there was a vessel set there full of vinegar. And they, putting a sponge full of vinegar about hyssop, put it to his mouth.

                        <p>
                            For just a moment, place yourself at the foot of Jesus' Cross. The cruelest violences, insults and indignities the Son of God was not spared! 
                            Turn, and behold his poor mother standing there... hardly willing to breath the air, dissolved in an ocean of tears as she watched him slowly 
                            die in writhing agony!  Her tortured heart pierced through with burning swords of unimaginable pain and sorrow for her beloved Son... 
                            to the point of death.  If not for the grace of God, Mary surely would have died a thousand deaths that day.<br /><br />
                            Mary had been dreading this moment for more than 30 years since the Prophesy of Simeon.  Do you not think that every time she even looked at 
                            her tender son, in all that time, it did not pain her to think of the terrible death that awaited him?<br /><br />
                            Think about the Sacred Hands and Feet of Jesus for just a moment. Think about Mary who smothered them with kisses, 
                            as any tender mother would her sweet baby.  These same sacred hands used to heal and to bless, these same precious feet used to bring the 
                            good news to the poor and the hopeless, she saw driven through with cruel nails, bloodied and pinned to a crude wooden cross.<br /><br />
                            Can we see Mary's suffering and not help but have compassion for her also? And in imitation of the beloved apostle St. John, not want to take 
                            her into our homes care for, comfort her... even as our own mother?

                        <blockquote>
                            It was the Day of Preparation, and to avoid the bodies' remaining on the cross during the Sabbath -- since that Sabbath was 
                            a day of special solemnity -- the Jews asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken away. Consequently the soldiers came and broke the 
                            legs of the first man who had been crucified with him and then of the other. When they came to Jesus, they saw he was already dead, 
                            and so instead of breaking his legs one of the soldiers pierced his side with a lance; and immediately there came out blood and water.
                            This is the evidence of one who saw it -- true evidence, and he knows that what he says is true -- and he gives it so that you may believe as well.
                            Because all this happened to fulfill the words of scripture: Not one bone of his will be broken;
                            and again, in another place scripture says: They will look to the one whom they have pierced.
                            After this, Joseph of Arimathaea, who was a disciple of Jesus -- though a secret one because he was afraid of the Jews -- asked Pilate to let him 
                            remove the body of Jesus. Pilate gave permission, so they came and took it away.
                            Nicodemus came as well -- the same one who had first come to Jesus at night-time -- and he brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, weighing about a hundred pounds.

                            Before Jesus is taken down from the cross, His adorable body is struck by the lance of a soldier.  Blood and water issue forth from his side. 
                            The nails are pulled from his hands and feet, and He is lowered down the cross on a ladder. Jesus, all bloodied, bruised, torn and lifeless,
                            is placed in his poor mother's arms. The Crown of thorns having been removed, Mary can now see with horror, the deep puncture wounds 
                            left in His forehead by the long sharp thorns.<br /><br />
                            The Sorrowful Mother beholds the holes in Jesus' Hands and Feet that bore the weight of His body as he hung on crude nails; 
                            the terrible wound in His side.  His once beautiful face, now swollen and bruised from the reed used by the Romans to strike him 
                            viciously about the head after crowning him with thorns and veiling his face.<br /><br />
                            The Most Sorrowful Mother ponders with deepest emotions all the multiple cruel and mortal wounds her Divine Son willingly endured for humanity. 
                            But mixed with her unspeakable pain and grief is a certain motherly pride in her Son, as she knows of the countless souls he has saved by this 
                            greatest act of His unselfish love. Does she tenderly kiss his adorable head, and wash his Face with her tears, or does she have any tears left to cry?

                            At the place where he had been crucified there was a garden, and in this garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been buried.
                            Since it was the Jewish Day of Preparation and the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.

                            Jesus body is wrapped in a cloth, and he is buried quickly and without ceremony in a borrowed sinners' tomb.  
                            His sweet mournful mother bids farewell to the precious body of her son, all bloodied and torn for us.  She gently kisses his 
                            wounded hands and lays them back over his body.  She takes her place with the other women as they roll the heavy stone back over 
                            the entrance to the tomb.<br /><br />
                            She watches as the stone falls in place with a final great thud. There are no birds singing, the world is silent. And silently, 
                            one by one they slowly, tearfully depart. The pain in her soul is so great that surely if not for the grace of God, 
                            she would have died of grief a thousand times over that day. O Poor Sweet Holy Mother!<br /><br />
                            The beloved apostle St. John urges the Blessed Virgin Mary to leave with him, but she is frozen to the spot, unable to move.  
                            Placing his arm gently around her shoulders, choking back the tears St. John speaks softly the word,<br /><br />
                            "Mother."<br /><br />
                            The Blessed Virgin Mary raising her tearful eyes to meet John's realizes her duty towards her beloved Son Jesus now lies with his children, 
                            begotten at his death.  Mary then became for us the adopted mother of us all. Jesus' final gift to us before his dying breath.
                            Slowly the beloved apostle of her Divine Son leads the stricken mother away from the scene to his home.
